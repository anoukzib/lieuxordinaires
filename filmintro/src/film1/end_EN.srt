1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,140
This film unlike the usual cinema

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,100
reintroduces us into life.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,500
People are in front of the film

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,000
as in everyday life. 

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,000
That is, they are not guided because


6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,500
we did not guide the spectators.


7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,100
We did not say,


8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,900
such is kind, such is bad,


9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,050
such is friendly, such is intelligent.


10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,000
And then, in front of these people whom they could meet in life,


11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,220
they are helpless.


12
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,800
They feel that they are being questioned themselves,


13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,230
they feel concerned and they try to refuse.
