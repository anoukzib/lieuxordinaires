1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,170
So Reykjavík,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,000
is almost a third of the island's population.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There are many green spaces

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,200
and a lot of individualism.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,000
People want to have a detached house.


6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Nature is all around Reykjavík.


7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's a pretty quiet city.


8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,200
I live in the centre where there is the lacquer


9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:33,200
which is in the heart of the city,


10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,000
just next to the cemetery


11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,250
where I often go.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:47,000
I actually go through the cemetery to go to work, to university.


13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,000
You can walk everywhere.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,500
The sea is everywhere.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You can see the sea and the mountains

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
around Reykjavík everywhere.

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,000
It’s the same in the centre.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,240
 It’s a quiet town.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:19,000
We wake up, we listen to the silence.
